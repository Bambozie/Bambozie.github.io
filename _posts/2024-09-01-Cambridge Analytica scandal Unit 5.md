## Task: Analysis of Survey Misuse for Data Harvesting

In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.

**Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.**

# Analysis of Inappropriate Use of Surveys for Data Harvesting

The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 highlighted a serious issue regarding the inappropriate use of online surveys to harvest personal data for undisclosed purposes. The data obtained through seemingly harmless Facebook surveys was used to influence political campaigns and targeted advertising, affecting both the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and the Brexit referendum. The incident raised numerous ethical, legal, social, and professional concerns, as users’ trust was violated when their data was shared and used without explicit consent.

## Ethical Implications
Cambridge Analytica's actions violated basic ethical principles regarding informed consent, privacy, and the use of personal data. Users were unaware that by participating in surveys, they were giving access to much broader data about themselves and their Facebook friends, which was then sold and used for political manipulation. This breach of trust damages the public's perception of tech companies and raises ethical concerns about corporate responsibility.

## Social Implications
The misuse of data in this case undermined democracy by influencing voter behavior based on targeted psychological profiling. It also led to a societal debate about the role of social media platforms and the power they wield in shaping political and social realities. The broader impact includes an erosion of trust in online platforms and in the democratic process itself.

## Legal Implications
The scandal resulted in legal action against both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. In the UK, the company was investigated under the Data Protection Act 1998, and in the U.S., Facebook faced significant fines for violating users' privacy rights under the Federal Trade Commission's regulations. The case set a precedent for legal reforms such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, emphasizing stricter data protection and user consent laws.

## Professional Implications
From a professional standpoint, this case highlighted a failure in data stewardship and a breach of the professional code of conduct. Professionals involved in data collection and processing, such as data scientists and marketers, have a duty to maintain transparency and respect user privacy. The scandal has led to increased scrutiny on the ethical standards of professionals working in data analytics and marketing, emphasizing the need for stronger accountability measures.

## Further Examples of Inappropriate Use of Surveys

### 1. 2019 Google “Project Nightingale”
In 2019, Google’s collaboration with Ascension, a major healthcare provider in the U.S., under "Project Nightingale" raised concerns as patient data was collected and shared without explicit consent. Although framed as an attempt to improve healthcare services, there was significant outcry regarding the ethical implications of using personal health data for potential commercial gains, highlighting the risks of inappropriate data collection practices.

### 2. Ashley Madison Data Breach (2015)
The Ashley Madison dating site, which facilitated extramarital affairs, was hacked in 2015, leading to the exposure of millions of users' personal details. Although this wasn’t a survey-based breach, it raised questions about the ethical management of sensitive data. Users trusted the site with deeply personal information, and when this data was improperly secured, it resulted in social harm, personal embarrassment, and legal consequences for those affected.

## Impact of These Examples
The misuse of surveys and personal data collection techniques across different industries demonstrates the wide-reaching impact of data privacy issues.

- **Ethical Impact**: It highlights the importance of gaining explicit consent and the ethical obligation to inform users clearly about how their data will be used.
  
- **Social Impact**: These cases erode public trust in organizations that handle data, leading to hesitation in engaging with digital services and a growing demand for privacy-focused solutions.
  
- **Legal Impact**: Such scandals lead to significant legal actions and stricter data protection laws globally, as seen with GDPR and other data privacy regulations.
  
- **Professional Impact**: Data scientists, marketers, and IT professionals are now under greater pressure to act responsibly, comply with regulations, and follow strict ethical standards when dealing with personal data.

The Cambridge Analytica case and others like it serve as cautionary tales, emphasizing the need for greater transparency, ethical conduct, and robust legal frameworks in the handling of personal data.
