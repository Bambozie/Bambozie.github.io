# F-Test Analysis of Income by Gender

## Key Results

### Mean Income
- **Males**: 53.12
- **Females**: 44.42

*This indicates that the average income for males in this dataset is higher than that for females.*

### Variance
- **Males**: 234.49
- **Females**: 191.28

*The variance, reflecting the spread of the income data, is higher for males. This suggests that incomes for males have a wider range than for females.*

### F-Test Statistics
- **F-statistic (F)**: 1.23  
  *This is the test statistic for the F-test, calculated as the ratio of the variances (male variance divided by female variance). A value of F far from 1 indicates a significant difference in the variances.*

- **P-value (P(F â‰¤ f), one-tail)**: 0.22  
  *The p-value of 0.22 is higher than typical significance levels like 0.05, suggesting there is no statistically significant difference in the variances of the income distributions between males and females.*

- **F Critical (one-tail)**: 1.55  
  *The F-critical value is the threshold that the F-statistic must exceed to reject the null hypothesis (that the variances are equal). Since 1.23 (the calculated F-statistic) is less than 1.55, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.*

## Conclusion
### Interpretation
Based on the F-test results, there is **no statistically significant difference** between the variances of income for males and females in this dataset. Although the average income for males is higher, the spread of incomes (as measured by variance) does not differ significantly between the two groups.
