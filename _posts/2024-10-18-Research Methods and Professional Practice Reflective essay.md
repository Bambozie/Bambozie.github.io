## Introduction
Throughout this module, I have significantly developed my knowledge and skills, particularly in the domains of cybersecurity, statistical analysis, and critical research methods. The module has been pivotal in refining both my theoretical understanding and my practical abilities in various areas, especially regarding Literature Review, Research Proposals and cryptographic methods.

## What?
The module involved several tasks, each of which contributed to my overall understanding of cybersecurity concepts and research methodologies. I worked on diverse activities, from conducting statistical analyses to developing a literature review on cloud security risks in the healthcare sector. One of the significant projects was cryptography research, which required me to delve deep into Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and key delegation — areas that were new to me but essential for addressing healthcare data security in the cloud.

Additionally, I undertook various reflective and professional skills-building activities, such as constructing a professional skills matrix, which helped me identify gaps in my current skill set and plan actionable steps to improve. These activities guided me to think critically about my strengths in cloud security and how I could address areas like advanced encryption and research methodologies.


## So What?
The most significant learning point from this module was how theory connects to practice. For example, learning about FHE introduced me to cutting-edge encryption techniques that solve real-world problems, particularly in sectors like healthcare. As a system administrator, I had previously focused on securing networks and systems without delving much into cryptography. This module pushed me to learn about newer security paradigms that align with the evolving threat landscape, a field that demands constant learning.

During my research on cloud security risks, I became aware of how critical encryption is for protecting sensitive healthcare data, especially when hosted in the cloud. This task required a lot of independent work, as I had to evaluate academic sources and synthesize them into a coherent literature review. It taught me how to apply research methods in a structured way, ensuring my findings were well-supported. I felt challenged by the depth of analysis required, particularly in ensuring academic rigor. This challenge pushed me to improve my time management and critical thinking skills.

The statistical exercises in Units 7 and 8 were equally insightful. They involved using data analysis techniques, I realized that my approach to data in a cybersecurity context — like analyzing event logs or identifying attack patterns — could benefit from statistical methods. While I had basic statistical knowledge, the exercises enhanced my understanding of how to apply this knowledge to validate assumptions, an essential skill in security infrastructure design.

## The Emotional Part
Initially, I felt overwhelmed by the workload and the complexity of some tasks, especially the literature review. However, as I broke down each task into manageable components, my confidence grew. Tackling complex issues like cryptography, which seemed intimidating at first, became more engaging as I immersed myself in the research. I found satisfaction in completing tasks and gaining deeper insights into my professional field.

The research proposal and literature review tasks were particularly daunting, given that academic writing was not my strongest skill. However, by reflecting on feedback and iterating my approach, I learned to appreciate the process of academic research. It also helped me become more comfortable with critical analysis and drawing upon multiple sources of information to form well-reasoned arguments.

## Now What?
Reflecting on this module, I now have a clearer understanding of how to apply the knowledge gained. First, I plan to further develop my expertise in cryptographic methods, particularly in the healthcare sector. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is one area where I see tremendous potential, and I aim to explore how this encryption method can be practically implemented in cloud systems.

In my professional role as a system administrator, I will apply the insights gained from statistical analysis to enhance the accuracy of system monitoring and threat detection. By integrating statistical validation into my analysis of network logs and system alerts, I can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems (IDS) and better predict potential threats.

Furthermore, my enhanced understanding of cloud security risks, particularly in healthcare, has made me more aware of the ethical responsibilities tied to managing sensitive data. I plan to implement specifically tuned security measures based on what I learned in this module. This will not only improve the security posture of the networks I manage but also ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards in data protection.

I also plan to revisit my professional skills matrix periodically to track my progress and refine my action plan. This will ensure that I stay on top of emerging technologies and trends in cybersecurity and continue to align my professional development with industry needs.

## Conclusion
Overall, this module has had a profound impact on both my professional and personal growth. It has helped me bridge gaps in my understanding of critical cybersecurity issues, statistical methods, and research methodologies. My reflections have allowed me to assess my progress and identify areas for future improvement, and I now feel better equipped to tackle challenges in my current role and in my ongoing professional development. The experience has shown me the value of continuous learning, which I will carry forward into my future work in IT and cybersecurity.
