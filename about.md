## About

Hi, I am a dedicated Master's in Cybersecurity student, set to graduate in April, with over three years of hands-on experience as a Networks & Infrastructure Officer. My expertise spans across managing and securing both network and infrastructure systems, where I have consistently ensured seamless operations, optimized performance, and reinforced cybersecurity protocols. With a strong foundation in technical solutions and a passion for safeguarding digital environments, I am eager to contribute my skills to innovative IT projects and further enhance my knowledge in the field.
